 * Header file for \ref tree-gen.
 *
 * \page tree-gen tree-gen
 * tree-gen is a code generator that outputs all the repetitive stuff needed
 * for defining a proper tree structure in C++.
 *
 * Trees are described by *.tree files. Such a file consists of a number of
 * directives at the top and one or more tree node descriptions. Each tree node
 * gets its own C++ class, with a bunch of methods defined on it for traversal,
 * the visitor pattern, safe typecasting, cloning, and so on. It would be
 * extremely tedious and error prone to define all this stuff manually, hence
 * the generator.
 *
 * It is important to realize and perhaps not immediately obvious that the
 * recursive structure in a *.tree file represents C++ inheritance rather than
 * the actual tree structure. You may for instance encounter something like
 * this:
 *
 * ```
 * expression {
 *     addition {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *     subtraction {
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * That doesn't mean an expression consists of an addition and a subtraction,
 * but rather that an addition is a type of expression, and subtraction is
 * another.
 *
 * \section base Base classes and primitives
 *
 * Before we can properly define what a tree looks like, we need a few base
 * classes and primitives defined outside of the generated code, for the
 * generated code to use/depend on. The five required base classes are:
 *
 *  - `Base`: all generated node classes inherit from this class.
 *  - `Maybe<T>`: class used when zero or one references to a child node of
 *    type `T` are needed.
 *  - `One<T>`: class used when exactly one reference to a child node of type
 *    `T` is needed.
 *  - `Any<T>`: class used when zero or more references to child nodes of type
 *    `T` are needed.
 *  - `Many<T>`: class used when one or more references to child nodes of type
 *    `T` are needed.
 *
 * The namespace these classes are to be found in can be set using the
 * `tree_namespace` directive at the top of the tree file. The generator
 * expects `Maybe<T>` and `One<T>` to have an overload of dereferencing to
 * access the child node, whereas it expects `Any<T>` and `Many<T>` to behave
 * like a vector of `One<T>`. It also expects Maybe/One/Any/Many to have an
 * is_complete() method, returning whether all constraints are met (One has a
 * node, the array for a Many is not empty, all array entries of Any/Many are
 * filled), in order to be able to generate such a method for the nodes, to
 * check the constraints of the entire (sub)tree.
 *
 * The other set of types needed are primitive types. These are used to
 * represent data on the nodes. For instance, an integer literal node have some
 * primitive integer attached to it to represent the value. Primitive nodes
 * need to have a stream operator<< overload for the debug dumps. The generated
 * code also assumes that there is a function with prototype `T()` defined for
 * all primitive types T, that returns a sane default value to initialize the
 * members of nodes with when they are not specified in the constructor. This
 * prevents node members of an actual C++ primitive type from being
 * uninitialized by default. The namespace and name of the function is specified
 * with the `initialize_function` directive.
 *
 * \section nodes Defining nodes
 *
 * Nodes have the following form in the tree file:
 *
 * ```
 * # [documentation for node class]
 * [snake_case_node_name] {
 *
 *     # [documentation for primitive]
 *     [snake_case_member_name]: [C++ namespace path];
 *
 *     # [documentation for child node]
 *     [snake_case_member_name]: [Maybe|One|Any|Many]<[TitleCaseNodeName]>;
 *
 *     # [documentation for external child node]
 *     [snake_case_member_name]: external [Maybe|One|Any|Many]<[C++ namespace path]>;
 *
 *     [zero or more specializations of this node; recursive structure]
 *
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Nodes can have zero or more primitives, zero or more child nodes, zero or
 * more *external* child nodes, and zero or more specializations.
 *
 * The difference between normal child nodes and external child nodes is that
 * normal child nodes must resolve to another node in the same tree file, while
 * an external node uses any C++ type name for the node class. That allows you
 * to refer to nodes defined in other tree files as well. Note however that the
 * generator expects external nodes to actually be node classes, such that it
 * can properly generate the debug dump indentation logic, among other things.
 *
 * Note that the name of a node *has* to be specified in `snake_case`, while
 * the generated class is named in `TitleCase`. This is just because it's easier
 * to convert snake case to title case than vice versa, and the generator uses
 * both forms (title case for the class names, snake case for methods and
 * members).
 *
 * Note also the comments explicitly added to the example. These comments are
 * actually used by the generator; they are copied into the source code using
 * javadoc-style comment blocks.
 *
 * The order in which nodes are defined doesn't matter. This allows you to make
 * recursive tree structures, without having to worry about forward
 * declarations. The generator handles those.
 *
 * \section directive Directives
 *
 * The following directives exist. They should be placed at the top of the tree
 * file, before the first node. Their order doesn't matter, unless otherwise
 * specified. Note that most directives are required.
 *
 *  - `source "<filename>"`: sets the filename for the generated C++ file. Any
 *    comment above the directive is copied into the file as file-level doxygen
 *    documentation.
 *
 *  - `header "<filename>"`: sets the filename for the generated header file.
 *    Any comment above the directive is copied into the file as file-level
 *    doxygen documentation.
 *
 *  - `tree_namespace <namespace::path>`: the namespace that the
 *    Base/Maybe/One/Any/Many classes live in. Comment is ignored.
 *
 *  - `initialize_function <namespace::path::initialize>`: the name (including
 *    namespace path leading up to it) of the `T()` function used for getting
 *    the default value of any of the used primitive classes. Comment is
 *    ignored.
 *
 *  - `location <namespace_path::SourceLocation>`: optionally, the name of the
 *    source location annotation class (including namespace path leading up to
 *    it). The debug dump will look for an annotation of this type on each node
 *    when doing a debug dump, and if it exists, uses it to add source
 *    information to the node, by streaming out a `#` followed by the stream
 *    overload for the class. The base class needs to be capable of annotations
 *    if you use this. Comment is ignored.
 *
 *  - `include "<path>"`: adds an `#include` statement to the top of the
 *    generated header file. Comment is ignored.
 *
 *  - `src_include "<path>"`: like `include`, but adds to the top of the
 *    generated C++ file only.
 *
 *  - `namespace <name>`: used to specify the namespace for the generated tree
 *    classes. As in C++, you need multiple of these to specify the full path.
 *    The comment for the *first* annotation of this type that has a comment
 *    in front is used to document the innermost namespace javadoc-style for
 *    Doxygen documentation.
 *
 * \section apis Generated APIs
 *
 * The following methods are generated for each node class:
 *
 *  - a constructor with all members of the node in its signature as optional
 *    values, defaulting to the values returned by the initializer function.
 *
 *  - `bool is_complete() const`: returns whether the node its called on and
 *    any subtree rooted in that node is fully defined (no empty One or Many,
 *    all array entries in Any/Many nonempty).
 *
 *  - `%NodeType type() const`: returns the type of this node, using the
 *    also-generated %NodeType enumeration.
 *
 *  - `One<Node> clone() const`: returns a shallow copy of this node.
 *
 *  - An equality and inequality operator. Note that this ignores equality of
 *    any annotations.
 *
 *  - `void visit(Visitor &visitor)`: implements the visitor pattern using the
 *    also-generated abstract Visitor/RecursiveVisitor classes. See below.
 *
 *  - `void dump(std::ostream &out=std::cout, int indent=0)`: does a debug
 *    dump of the node to the given stream with the given indentation level.
 *
 *  - `SomeNodeType *as_some_node_type()`: does the equivalent of a
 *    `dynamic_cast` to the given node type, returning `this` if the type is
 *    correct or `nullptr` if not.
 *
 * An implicit node class simply named `Node` is always generated, serving as
 * the base class for all other nodes. It is what derives from the `Base` class
 * defined along with `Maybe/One/Any/Many`.
 *
 * Tree traversal is complicated by the fact that you often don't know exactly
 * which type a class is. For example, an expression node may actually be a
 * subtraction or addition. There are a few different patterns supported by
 * tree-gen:
 *
 *  - *Visitor pattern.* You define a class inheriting from the generated
 *    `Visitor` or `RecursiveVisitor` classes. These abstract classes provide
 *    or require you to implement functions for each node type. The appropriate
 *    one then gets called when you pass an instance of your visitor class to
 *    the `visit()` method on a node. You must always override `visit_node()`,
 *    usually to throw a suitable exception in case an unexpected node is
 *    encountered. The default implementation for all the other node types
 *    differs between the two classes. For `Visitor`, the default implementation
 *    falls back to the next more generically typed function
 *    (`visit_subtraction()` falls back to `visit_expression()`,
 *    `visit_expression()` falls back to `visit_node()`). For
 *    `RecursiveVisitor`, the default implementation for non-leaf node types
 *    recursively calls `visit()` for all child nodes, thus recursively
 *    traversing the tree. For leaf nodes, both visitor classes have the same
 *    behavior.
 *
 *  - *Using the `as_*()` methods.* Given for instance an expression node, you
 *    might do
 *    ```
 *    if (auto addition = expression.as_addition()) {
 *      ...
 *    } else if (auto subtraction = expression.as_subtraction()) {
 *      ...
 *    } else {
 *      ...
 *    }
 *    ```
 *    Because a `nullptr` evaluates to false in C++, the blocks will only be
 *    executed if the cast succeeds. Be careful copypasting though; you can
 *    accidentally use the `addition` variable in the `subtraction` block if
 *    you'd want, but it's obviously null in that case. C++ scoping is weird.
 *
 *  - *Using a switch statement.* You might do
 *    ```
 *    switch (expression.type()) {
 *      case NodeType::Addition:
 *        ...
 *      case NodeType::Subtraction:
 *        ...
 *    }
 *    ```
 *    This doesn't handle the cast for you, but in cases where you only need to
 *    switch based on the type and don't need access to members of the nodes
 *    this is more descriptive than the if/else form.
 *
 * Just choose the method that makes the most sense within context.
